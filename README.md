# UCF Contact manager
A simple contact management platform run through a LAMP Stack, which was hosted on DigitalOcean for our presentation in the COP4331C at the University of Central Florida. 

## Why?
Our team was instructed to build and deploy a working Contact Management application for our first project in the course. In just a matter of weeks, we went from a group average of zero web development experience to a firmer understanding of Web2.0 technologies, including HTML/CSS/JS, jQuery, MySQL, PHP, and Apache server. 

## How? 
1. We drew out a simple site design on Draw.io.
2. We recreated these plans using Bootstrap Studio, aiming for a simple, accessible, responsive design centered around UCF's official colors.
3. We hosted our project on DigitalOcean and fiddled around with the git CLI to grab commits from here and pull them onto our production machine when ready. 
4. We did a lot of testing and refactoring to make sure all of the individual parts of our project fit together well.

## Special Notes
As our first foray into web development, this was not a bad effort. It is our belief that our site functioned more reliably and more elegantly than most of the other submissions, but it is also important to mention that this was not a criterion for grading. Rather, we just wanted to submit as professional work as we could.
